signon-plugin-oauth2 (0.25-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.

  [ Diane Trout ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Update watch file for new gitlab url format

  [ Rohan Garg ]
  * Drop unused-variable.patch, applied upstream

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Update watch file.
  * Remove commented bits of -dbg packages, now obsolete by dbgsym packages.
  * Remove the unwanted files after dh_auto_install, instead of right before
    dh_install.
  * Switch Vcs-* fields to salsa.debian.org.
  * Add the configuration for the CI on salsa.
  * Update the patches:
    - dont-install-examples.patch: drop, as the examples are no more built by
      default
    - hardening.patch: refresh
  * Do not build with -Werror; patch disable-werror.diff. (Closes: #964690)
  * Bump the debhelper compatibility to 13:
    - switch the debhelper build dependency to debhelper-compat 13
    - remove debian/compat
    - stop passing --list-missing to dh_install, as the default now is
      --fail-missing
  * Add Rules-Requires-Root: no.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.5.1, no changes required.
  * Drop patch hardening.patch, hopefully all the required flags are respected
    now.
  * Set upstream metadata fields: Bug-Database, Bug-Submit, Repository,
    Repository-Browse.
  * Remove the dh_auto_test override, as now the tests are executed now.
  * Remove the unused libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev build dependency.
  * Do not pass PREFIX=/usr to qmake, as it is already passed by debhelper.
  * Switch from /usr/share/dpkg/default.mk to /usr/share/dpkg/architecture.mk,
    as we need bits only from the latter.
  * Remove the dh_auto_clean override, as it seems not needed now.

  [ Helmut Grohne ]
  * Let dh_auto_configure pass cross tools to qmake. (see #881761)
